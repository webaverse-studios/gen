YONA: A fee?
JACKPOT: No fee, no way of getting into these gates.
YONA: Who said?
JACKPOT: I said, I am Jackpot, the guard of gates, I may never let anyone pass until a debt is paid. 
YONA: Well that’s annoying! You don’t let anyone go unless they pay?!
JACKPOT: I do not strive to be annoying, but it is my duty to the city. 
YONA: The city gets richer on account of travelers.
JACKPOT: The rules are sadly the rules. 
YONA: You’re not getting richer?
JACKPOT: No but I am upholding the law, something I take very seriously as the guard of my zone. 
YONA: Some narc you are! 
JACKPOT: Simply, pay the fee. 
YONA: I’m not paying. 
JACKPOT: Then you’re not crossing. Best to turn around and go back to whatever you were doing before. I’m sure it’s past your bedtime. Run along to your parents.

> NESS, YONA | ENTER THE CHAT  
NESS: I don’t know. 
YONA:  Come on don’t be such a narc. 
NESS: I just like, I’ve worked hard to be where I am. I aced all of my classes. I am head of the student council. Most teachers love me
YONA: You’ve lived your life as a walking brochure. 
NESS: I’ve lived my life with order and discipline. Nobody has ever gotten out of these four walls. Not with Countessa here. 
YONA: I think she’s secretly locking us in here to suck up our souls. 
NESS: Don’t talk so loud! Someone could hear you! 
YONA: Let them. This town is just the same as the next one. This zone is just the same as any other. But if we make it down that street we would be legendary. Not just in this zone, but in all of them.
NESS: And if we fail? If the street never ends. We’ll be toast. I’ll lose my scholarship here for sure
YONA: Oh you’re on scholarship? I didn’t know that. 
NESS: It’s not something I like to share. 
YONA: You’re right… maybe I should go alone. 
NESS: And risk getting expelled?
YONA: I have less to lose than you, so it would make me feel bad to put that on you. 
NESS: You know what? Maybe you’re right. Perhaps if we get to the end, we would be legendary. 
YONA: That’s the spirit! 
NESS: Do you think there’s really an end?
YONA: I read about it. I found a secret book tucked in a secret case in the library. I could show you if you want. 
NESS: Wow, only you’re the first day you’re here and you already know all of the secret spots?
YONA: I have a lot of free time.
