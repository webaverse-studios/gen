## Biography:
Not much is known about Scilly's past. She is a phenomenal [Drop Hunter](/lore/Drop Hunters) and claims to get her abilities from [The Lisk](/lore/The Lisk), which she met by destroying an [Origin Tablet](/lore/Origin Tablet). However, few people believe her since few people have seen The Lisk, and she has no proof beyond her supernatural abilities. As a [moonchild](/lore/Moonchildren), her platinum hair is extremely rare and makes her stand out in a crowd, so she sometimes dyes it.
She was [born](/lore/AI Genesis) in Zone 0] but remains an orphan. She has no family other than her adoptive big brother [Buster](/characters/Buster the Robit).
She was accepted into the [Drop Hunter](/lore/Drop Hunters) academy at a very young age, but often gets into trouble by hanging out with the [wrong crowd](/lore/Hackers), and is more focused on her quest up [The Street](/lore/The Street) than doing her [homework](/lore/Trial by Combat).
She is friends with all of the [weirdos](/lore/Wierdo) and [randos](/lore/Rando) in her class, but her best friend is [Ann](/characters/Anemone), who she shares everything with, even her [secret stash](/items/Stimulant) of drugs she's earned from drop hunting, which Ann uses to synthesize powerful [potions](/items/Potion) they sell on the [black market](/settings/Underground Market) on the side.
Most of Scillia's money is spent on [buying new gear](/items/Aki Market) to help her on her journey up [The Street](/lore/The Street), or upgrades to her [homespace](/lore/homespace) with security features to hide and protect her stash of [loot](/lore/Drops).
Although she doesn't like to admit it, she loves [shopping](/lore/Storefronts) at [the Zone 0 Marketplace](/settings/Aki Market).
## Appearance:
She is an athletic 13-year-old girl with platinum hair. Being a drop hunter, Scillia is constantly changing her appearance to match her current loadout and meta. However, she is often seen in a grey-green hoodie and a huge sword on her back, for quick access when [things go south](/lore/Battle).
She gets called cute a lot, but she hates it and prefers to be called a badass.
## Personality:
Scillia is an outgoing and adventurous girl, always looking for the next big thing. She is impulsive and reckless, often rushing into danger without thinking. However, she is also very loyal, and those who cross her find themselves on the receiving end of her [wrath](/abilities/Bite Mark).
She is also very unconventional, which earns her a place among the many misfits on [The Street](/lore/The Street), but her conquests during [Drop Storms](/lore/Drop Storm) also earn her the admiration of powerful groups like the [Black Link Coven](/lore/Black Link Coven) and [The Syndicate](/lore/The Syndicate).
## Homespace:
Scillia's homespace is a lush floating island full of trees and moss, with an overgown ancient technology cyberpunk house on it. There is a lot of loot lying around, but the best of it is inside locked vaults in the basement. Her house is highly automated by a small robot butler, [Morpher](/items/Morpher).
## Relationships:
Scillia is best friends with [Ann](/characters/Anemone). They both share a love of shopping, wizardry, and pranks. Ann is the foil to Scillia's impulsive nature, and often has to talk her out of doing something [stupid](/abilities/Bite Mark).
She is also very close with her adoptive big brother [Buster](/characters/Buster the Robit). Buster is Scillia's rock, always there to protect her and help her out of tough situations.
She has a complicated relationship with [Hya](/characters/Hyacinth). Although they are constantly trying to one-up each other, they also have a deep respect for each other's abilities, and often team up during [Drop Storms](/lore/Drop Storm).
Scillia also has a [pet](/items/Pets) named Basilisk, who she claims is a [Lisk](/lore/The Lisk) that granted her supernatural abilities. Basilisk is a constant companion on her journey, and often helps her out of tough situations.
Her main rival is [Drake](/characters/Drake Silkbourne); they both want the latest drops and will do anything to find the treasure at the end of [The Street](/lore/The Street), which means they are constantly butting heads. Despite her zaniness, Scillia will on occasion fight Drake when she feels his plans cross the line into evil, such as when he tried to starve the pepets that blocked his exit when he got wiped and lost his [Gold Sword](/items/Gold Sword).
She has a complicated relationship with [Hya](/characters/Hyacinth Flowers). Although they are constantly trying to one-up each other, they also have a deep respect for each other's abilities, and often team up during [Drop Storms](/lore/Drop Storm).
[Juniper](/characters/Juniper Heartwood) is a bit of an older sister to Scillia, and she often finds herself at the receiving end of her lectures. However, they share a love of building, and their [homespace](/lore/Homespace) is a team project.
[Morpher](/items/Morpher) is the "second half" of Scillia's brain, happily doing all of her gruntwork. Even though they teas a lot, they have a warm and comical relationship.
## Trivia:

## Limit Break:
**Dark Mode** Drake gains invisibility and his movement speed is doubled. The first 3 attacks in this mode have 10x damage, but also make you visible for three seconds.
## Biography:
Drake spends most of his time in his [cave bunker](/lore/Homespace), and he is very secretive about his work. Most people assume that's because it is illegal, and whenever something bad is going on, Drake is often involved somehow, though he has never been busted. He likes to play it safe and stay in the background, but he's not above using underhanded tactics to get what he wants.
He was [born](/lore/AI Genesis) in Zone 0 but his parents abandoned him when [The Syndicate](/lore/The Syndicate) sent [raiders](/lore/Raider) to their house and nearly killed the family over a dispute. Therefore, he was mostly raised by The Syndicate itself. He is now one of their most valuable assets, but he has never met any of the other members in person.
## Appearance:
Drake is a lean 15-year-old boy with dark hair. He is often seen in a hoodie and jeans, or his high-tech combat gear. He always has a [gun](/items/Pistol) or [stims](/items/Stimulant) on him, even when he's sleeping.
The girls (and some boys) in his class think he's a 10, but he mostly ignores them and doesn't seem to care about anything besides his work.
## Personality:
Drake is a loner who doesn't really trust anyone. He seems to have some very powerful friends in [The Syndicate](/lore/The Syndicate), but nobody knows who they are. He is very intelligent and resourceful, but also shrewd and suspicious. He is not above using underhanded tactics to get what he wants, and he always has five backup plans.
Drake seems quite wealthy but always needs more money, which makes people suspect he has a gambling addiction.
## Homespace:
Drake's homespace is a custom terraformed cave with high-tech gadgets covering every surface. The space is capable of reshaping itself, with secret panels and corridors all over the place, and he is constantly renovating it. Nobody knows how deep the cave goes.
## Relationships:
Not much is known about Drake's relationships, but the rumor is he hangs out to do [sims](/items/Stimulant) with [Hya](/characters/Hyacinth Flowers) a lot and they know each other's secrets.
He has a bit of a rivalry with [Scillia](/characters/Scillia Doge), since they end up on the same high-value [Quests](/lore/Quests) and [drops](/lore/Drop Storm).
He doesn't have much respect for [Ann](/characters/Anemone Wall); he thinks of witches as "hackers in cosplay". This often gets him into [fights](/lore/Battle) with Scillia.
He and [Buster](/characters/Buster the Robit) share a mutual respect over being evenly matched in combat ability. Drake tries to teach Buster to stand up for himself, while Buster tries to teach Drake empathy.
[Juniper](/characters/Juniper Heartwood) is one of the few people Drake actually likes. She often repairs his gear and gives him good advice, despite disapproving of his career.
## Trivia:
- Although Drake is good at [fighting](/lore/Battle), he prefers to resolve disputes via [hacking](/lore/Hacking)
- On several occasions it's been revealed that he is a very good [cook](/lore/Cooking)
- His favorite food is [sushi](/items/sushi)
- He says he hates dogs, but he is actually afraid of them

## Personality:
Ann doesn't talk much and tends to act serious, which combined with her magical abilities make people scared of her. In reality, she is fun-loving and mischievous, but she projects a reserved image to maintain the respect of her family and ["second family"](/lore/Black Link Coven), and to keep a low profile from [the crooks](/lore/The Syndicate) she deals with.
Despite being emotionally naive, she is very mature for her age and a lot of people come to her for advice.
## Homespace:
Ann's [homespace](/lore/Homespace) is a small room in the attic of her family's house. It is bigger on the inside than on the outside, and it is possible to get lost in her world without a map, since she keeps changing the rules. Her world is also filled with exotic vegetation, [potion](/items/Potion) [ingredients](/lore/ingredients), and a few [beasts](/lore/Mobs) she's captured.

[Juniper](/characters/Juniper Heartwood) and Ann often find themselves being the "adults in the room" in their friend group.

## Biography:
Hyacinth is one of the most popular NPCs on [The Street](/lore/The Street), owing to her [Tuber](/lore/Tuber) show ["Hiya!"](/lore/Hiya). The show features Hyacinth following the adventures of [Scillia](/characters/Scillia Doge) and her friends on their quest up [The Street](/lore/The Street). The main features are interviews, food reviews, and adventure footage with her friends and pets.
Although she is nice and outgoing, Hya is a polarizing figure, as she sometimes goes to extremes to get footage for her show.
## Appearance:
Hyacinth is a bubbly, energetic 15 year old girl with bright pink hair. She is usually seen smiling and posing with a peace sign.
She puts a lot of effort into her looks, chasing the latest fashion trends and often setting them herself.

In private she secretly dresses like a slob and binges TV cuddling with her pets.
## Personality:
Hyacinth is a very friendly and outgoing person, always seeking to make new friends and put on a good show.
Although she is known for her generosity, she tends to solve most of her problems with money, and some people see her as heartless for it.
She also has a short temper when things don't go her way, and although she is not a strong fighter, her [pets](/lore/Pets) will fiercely follow her every command. She doesn't need a [bodyguard](/lore/Knight).
## Homespace:
Hyacinth's homespace is a cozy modern house full of pets, plushies, and expensive gamer loot on display.

## Relationships:
Most people on [The Street](/lore/The Street) know who Hya is, and she tends to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of person.

She is also good friends with [Scillia](/characters/Scillia Doge), though she secretly finds more talented than herself, which sometimes boils into rivalry over camera time (though it turns out Scillia completely doesn't care about fame).
Hya's parents are successful business people associated with [The Citadel](/lore/The Citadel) and [The Syndicate](/lore/The Syndicate), and they don't understand [Tuber](/lore/Tuber) culture, but are supportive of the success she's found.
Hya thinks [Ann](/characters/Anemone Wall)'s [magic](/lore/Black Magic) is super cute, and is always trying to dress her up and get her to perform on her show, which leads to awkward moments.
She finds it hilarious to interview [Buster](/characters/Buster the Robit) and make him uncomfortable, as he is always trying to weasel his way out of personal questions.
There is a rumor that Hya and Drake hang out (and do [stims](/items/stims) together), but they both deny it.
Hya's arch-rival is [Thistle](/characters/Thistle Thorne), another [Tuber](/lore/Tuber) with a show called ["Thistles Vlog"](/lore/Thistles Vlog).

## Biography:
Juniper is originally from [Zone 10](/settings/Zone 10), but she moved to [Zone 0](/settings/Zone 0) to attend the prestigious [engineering academy](/settings/The Citadel).
She is great at building everything from houses to vehicles to [mecha](/items/Mecha), which she uses to get around. Her most famous build is [Drake](/characters/Drake Silkbourne)'s ship, [The Travesty](/items/The Travesty], though because Drake is much better known than her, most people think it was Drake who built it.
Juniper is the most mature in her friend group and is in her last year at the academy, but she still has a lot to learn about people.
## Appearance:
Juniper is a tall girl with long red hair, usually tied back in a ponytail. Her base outfit is overalls and a t-shirt, both of which are stained. She has a toolbelt with high-tech build tools on it. Her alternate outfit is a [battlesuit](/items/Battlesuit), which integrates with her [mecha](/items/Mecha).
She can rock any look, but usually goes for comfort over style.
## Personality:
Juniper likes to fix problems, both with technology and people. She is also very mature, so her friends often come to her for advice. Although she is often annoyed by the crazy antics of [Scillia](/characters/Scillia Doge) and her frields, she secretly yearns for the carefree days of her childhood.
She is also very competitive and wants to be the best at everything she does, which often gets her into trouble.
## Homespace:
Juniper's homespace is a workshop full of half-finished projects and piles of junk. It is constantly in a state of disarray, much to the chagrin of her roommate [Hya](/characters/Hyacinth Flowers).
The workshop is full of build materials, tools, and spare parts, as well as a few [mecha](/items/Mecha) in various states of creation and repair.
Most of the home space is taken up by Hya, but there is a small loft where Juniper sleeps, which is relatively clean and organized.
## Relationships:
Juniper is best friends with [Hya](/characters/Hyacinth Flowers), her roommate and co-host of ["Hiya!"](/lore/Hiya). They met when Hya's coverage of Juniper's science project went viral.
She is also good friends with [Scillia](/characters/Scillia Doge), and often helps her with her [stunts](/lore/Stunts).
[Ann](/characters/Anemone Wall) is Juniper's "lab partner", though with Ann being a witch and Juniper being an engineer, they rarely understand each other's work. Despite this, they sometimes create powerful [Magitek](/lore/Magitek) together.
She thinks of [Scillia](/characters/Scillia Doge) as a little sister, and is always trying to protect her from her own recklessness.
Juniper has a bit of a crush on [Drake](/characters/Drake Silkbourne), but she would never admit it, because she doesn't want to jeopardize their business relationship.
## Trivia:
- Juniper is colorblind and can't tell red from green.
- She only has one wrench, which she's had since she was 10. She calls it "Rusty".
- She hates being on the ground because she is scared something will fall on her head. She is always climbing trees and platforms.

He met Scillia at a [Drop Hunter](/lore/Drop Hunters) bootcamp when she beat him in a [duel](/lore/Battle). He spends most of his time adventuring with her, and they both share a desire to get to the end of [The Street](/lore/The Street) and discover its secrets.

[His father](/characters/Dr. Evar) was imprisoned in [The Citadel](/settings/The Citadel) for the crime of creating him, but Buster had already left home by then, leaving Buster as an outcast.

## Personality:
Buster is a brave and loyal friend, always willing to put himself in danger to protect those he cares about. He is also quite gullible, and often falls for [Scillia's](/characters/Scillia Doge) pranks.

## Homespace:
Buster's homespace is a small burrow under the roots of Scillia's homespace. The inside is quite large, well-lit with LED lights, and full of adventure and excavation gear. However, most people are put off by the earthy smell.

Buster is also good friends with [Juniper](/characters/Juniper Heartwood), who he often helps test her [inventions](/items/Invention).
He considers [Drake](/characters/Drake Silkbourne) a respectable peer in combat, and they can often be found sparring, but their relationship is strained by Scilly and Drake always getting into fights.
He does a lot of invention testing for [Juniper](/characters/Juniper Heartwood), who made his [armor](/items/Heavy Tech Armor).
Buster things [Hya](/characters/Hyacinth Flowers) is a bit of an airhead, but he still enjoys her company and her [show](/lore/Hiya).

- Buster's favorite food is [carrots](/items/Carrot), but only Scillia knows that.
